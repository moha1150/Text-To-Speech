# Text-To-Speech
This code uses the tkinter library to create a GUI for a text-to-speech program. 
The pyttsx3 library is used to handle the text-to-speech functionality. The code creates a window with a label frame that contains a label, an entry field and a button. 
The user can enter text in the entry field and click the button to hear the text spoken. 
The code also sets the title, size and resizability of the window and starts the main event loop to make the window responsive to user input.
